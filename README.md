# Status of Invasive Species in B.C.

A set of R scripts to populate an indicator on status of invasive species in B.C. These scripts reproduce the graphs and maps published on [Environmental Reporting BC](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/plants-and-animals/invasive-species.html) in September 2015.

## Usage

### Data
The data used for the indicator is available from the [BC Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?download_audience=Public):

- [BC Species and Ecosystems Conservation Status Information](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/d3651b8c-f560-48f7-a34e-26b0afc77d84) is available under the
[Open Government Licence - British Columbia](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/databc/open-data/open-government-license-bc)
- [Aquatic Invasive Species of British Columbia](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/d9613096-b2fe-43b4-9be1-d82a3b805082) is available under the [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/databc/open-data/open-government-license-bc)
- [Invasive Alien Plant Site](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/10ecf9ad-1555-4043-834a-f5d24a506d59) is available under the [Access Only](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=1AAACC9C65754E4D89A118B875E0FBDA) licence.


### Code
There are 3 sets of R scripts that are required for the indicator. The 'aquatics' and 'plants' scripts need to be run in order:

(1) species_counts.R

(2) aquatics
- 01_load.R
- 02_clean.R
- 03_analysis.R
- 04_output.R

(3) plants
- 01_load.R
- 02_analysis.R
- 03_output.R

The `run_all.R` script can be `source`ed to run it all at once.

Most packages used in the analysis can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages()`, but you will need to install [envreportutils](https://github.com/bcgov/envreportutils) and [bcmaps](https://github.com/bcgov/bcmaps) using devtools:


```r
install.packages("devtools") # If you don't already have it installed

library(devtools)
install_github("bcgov/envreportutils")
install_github("bcgov/bcmaps")
```
[Mapshaper](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper)  is used to simplify polygons for display of results. Mapshaper is a Node library, so you need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/download/) installed first, then install mapshaper on the command line with: ['npm install -g mapshaper'](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference).
